# Letter Dice Game

Welcome to the Letter Dice Game, an engaging and challenging word puzzle game inspired by the classic dice-based word game. This game is designed to be a self-contained, easy-to-set-up and play game that runs on Kubernetes.

## Overview

The Letter Dice Game generates a random board of letters by rolling dice with letters on each face. Players aim to find words in sequences of adjacent letters, where "adjacent" includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors. It's a fun and educational way to enhance your vocabulary and spelling skills!

## Features

- **Self-contained Deployment**: Everything you need is bundled in a single YAML file. 
- **Automatic Board Generation**: The board is randomly generated every 10 seconds, offering a new challenge each time.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: You can modify the script to change the dice configuration, altering the gameplay experience.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster
- Kubectl installed and configured to interact with your cluster
